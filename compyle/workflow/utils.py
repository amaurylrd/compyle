    This function uses Kahn's algorithm to compute a valid topological order
    of the steps, such that for every step A that depends on step B, B comes
    before A in the resulting list

    Algorithm:
        Kahn's algorithm â€” Time complexity: O(N + E)
        where:
            N = number of steps (nodes)

    Args:
        steps: An iterable of WorkflowStep instances.

    Returns:
        A list of WorkflowStep instances sorted in topological order.
